[[[ PROGRAM OVERVIEW ]]]

This training program is comprised of a series of interactive classroom courses, and provides official certification and ranking for the RPerl high-performance software platform.
Courses must be taken sequentially and in order; each course serves as a prerequisite for all following courses.
Students in each course must pass a formal examination before graduating and becoming elegible to begin the next course.
Graduates of each course will receive a framed certificate and 90 days of RPerl career mentorship.
Students must provide a laptop which can be totally wiped clean for fresh Linux and Perl installation.
